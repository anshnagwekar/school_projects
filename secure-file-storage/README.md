# Secure File Storage project

This was a project for my Advanced Web Apps Class during my senior year of high school. 

This is a simple file storage system that uses PHP password aunthetication and sessions to handle login features. It also creates a new secure directory for each user and displays files (along with size and date uploaded) that have been uploaded to the secure storage.
