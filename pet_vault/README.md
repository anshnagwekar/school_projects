# Pet Vault Project

This was a project for my Advanced Web Apps Class during my senior year of high school.

This is a password storage system that locks your passwords with extra security - your pets! When you create a Pet Vault account, you are given a set of 3 images for each type of pet - dog, cat, and fish - and you must remember these in order to enter your account (along with your traditional username and password). Once you are in, the Pet Vault is a secure password storage holder that stores your passwords, lets you add new ones, gives username and password suggestions for new passwords, and stores hosts and links. For future improvements, I would like to try implementing the list of features that I detailed in the "index.php" comments section. Thanks!
