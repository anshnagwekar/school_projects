Further improvements for login:
    * Logging in with just images and username (no string-style password)
    * Shuffling image order
    * Adding random "distracting" images
    * A "Rehearsal" page where you practice choosing your images until you have memorized them

Further improvements for password storage:
    * Encrypt passwords that are stored in the database
    * Offer suggestions based on previous passwords
    * Import/export passwords in CSV storage style
    * Enter multiple passwords at once
